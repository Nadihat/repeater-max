# Intention Repeater Max

25/9/2025: This repo was modified to contain v5.28 and its Python port, as well as ServitorConnect CLIv3.py.

The Intention Repeater MAX is outdated. See the ServitorConnect: https://github.com/tsweet77/servitor-connect

or the Intention Repeater Android: https://github.com/tsweet77/intention-repeater-android



intention_repeater.py is the newest addition to the Intention Repeater family.
It is the strongest Repeater to date. It allows you to run intentions at low frequencies,
such as 3Hz. This has been found to be more powerful than high speed PHz intentions.
It also allows for the use of Intention Multiplying with the Frequency; something that
the Intention Repeater MAX and CUDA can't do.

For help: intention_repeater_max.exe --help

Written in C++, this is the successor to the original Intention Repeater, written in Python.

The code, and the Servitor, were created by Anthro Teacher, aka Thomas Sweet.

It repeats your intention up to 10+EHz, to make things happen.

To compile your code: g++ -O3 -Wall -static intention_repeater_max.cpp -o intention_repeater_max.exe -lz

v5.10 .cpp requires picosha2.h and zlib.h
